Welcome! This is a to-do list manager. You can run it by running the Application.java file. Items are displayed in the text area.

Add an item to the list:
  Go to the toolbar at the bottom of the GUI and click "Make Item". This will then take you to the makeItemScreen where you can input the item details (e.g., item title, description, deadline, 
  and completion status) to make the new item. In more detail, type the item title and item description in their respective text fields, then select the deadline via the date picker, and, lastly,
  input 1 if the item is completed or 0 if the item is uncompleted for its completion status. Then, click "Submit Item", and you will be taken back to the home screen where you should see the new
  item displayed in the text area.

Remove an item from the list:
  Go to the text field that is above the toolbar and type the item you would like to remove. Then, go to the toolbar and click "Remove Item". This will then remove the item from the list and
